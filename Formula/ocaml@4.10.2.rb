# OCaml does not preserve binary compatibility across compiler releases,
# so when updating it you should ensure that all dependent packages are
# also updated by incrementing their revisions.
#
# Specific packages to pay attention to include:
# - camlp5
# - lablgtk
#
# Applications that really shouldn't break on a compiler update are:
# - coq
# - coccinelle
# - unison
